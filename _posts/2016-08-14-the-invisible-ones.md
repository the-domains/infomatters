## Test

## Here's to the invisible ones.  
The bohemians. The empiricists.   
The free-minds and the mediators.   
The shadow lives in the bright spots.   
The ones who make things happen.   
They're not fond of chaos. And they have no respect for inefficiencies.   
You can forget them, judge them, appreciate or discredit them. About the only thing you can't do is conform them.   
Because they are the change agents. They write the De Facto of the future.   
And while some may not even see them, we do.   
Because the people who are selfless enough to work behind the scene, are the ones who make it happen.
