  Here's to the invisible ones. The bohemians. The empiricists.  The free-minds
  and the mediators.  The shadow lives in the bright spots.  The ones who make
  things happen.  They're not fond of chaos. And they have no respect for
  inefficiencies.  You can forget them, judge them, appreciate or discredit
  them. About the only thing you can't do is conform them.  Because they are the
  change agents. They write the De Facto of the future.  And while some may not
  even see them, we do.  Because the people who are selfless enough to work
  behind the scene, are the ones who make it happen.
